Group 5

What kinds of users and how many? (Managers, Stockers, Cashiers, multiple or single, etc?)
It’s a very small operation. The only users are the food bank manager and volunteers.

What information is to be used to identify item locations? (Warehouse #, Aisle #, Shelf #, Bin #, etc?)
We store inventory and a storeroom that consists of a number of steel shelving units. We are not very organized at the moment, so we are open to your suggestions about storing – we could number the shelving units and label each shelf.

Is sample inventory data available? If so, please provide. (Spreadsheet of items? Samples of data to be stored?)
I’ll have to ask my volunteers to do an inventory. It may take them a week or so to get it for you.

What access and functionality should different types of users have? (Managers: add and remove location data/other users? Stock clerks: Moving items to different locations? etc.)
The food bank manager will use the application to monitor supply levels, the volunteers will use the app when accepting user donations, looking for items to fill a client request for food, and to update stock levels.

What depletion rates should be considered for notifying management to restock items? (once items drop below 50%, when depletion rate exceeds the usual rate during a given period of time, etc.)
If an item falls to 25% of its optimum supply level.

 

Group 2

What format will the input be in (csv, manually entered, etc.)?
The manager will provide an initial inventory as a csv file. Volunteers will adjust the stock levels manually in the application.

Will there be different privileges for different types of users, and if so, what are they?
What do you mean by ‘privileges’?

What is the threshold level? Or does the user specify the threshold level on their own?
The manager specifies the optimal level (for example, 10 jars of peanut butter) the minimum threshold will be 25% of that optimum level.

What is the calculation for the depletion rate?
The depletion rate is the average number of units used per day for a given item.

Are we going to be responsible for building and maintaining a database?  
Some mechanism to store the information is needed. You may choose to use a database, but it is not required.

 

Group 3

Should we conceive our own warehouse layout?
See question #2 from group 5.

What are "individual stock-keeping units"? Confusing description. (Elaboration request)
Maybe an example will help. A jar of peanut butter or a can of tuna is each an individual item.

What standards should we use to gage the levels of inventory?
What do you mean by ‘standards’?

Are the donations dynamic in size, or static? (I.e. population change needs to be considered or static population?)
Donations vary great.

"Record donations" how specifically? By weight and item? or more basic such as "Person Peter Xson donated on XX/XX/XX" with no specs
Donations should be recorded with the person’s name, their phone number, and the items donated are used to update the inventory.

 

Group 6

Q1: what kind of donations we are going to get? (should we accept both food supplies and money donations? And regarding money donations, should donations be taken electronically and by hand?)

            All donations are of non-perishable food items.

Q2: what kind of algorithm should we use (simple or complex) to build a model for accurately setting a threshold for every corresponding item?

            Do you mean the maximum inventory level or the minimum threshold?

Q3: Should employees have accounts with passwords and access the app, modify data, have certain privileges? (in other words, the app is going to be used by whom exactly).

            Yes, all users for the app need to log in with a password.

Q4: is the organization going to have different branches (warehouses), in which different items are stored in the different branches, so we can take into account the information about each branch.

The app can be used by any organization that downloads it, but for each download a single location is considered.

Q5: estimating the depletion rate for a group of items can be a simple task or a complex one. Would you like to use a simple algorithm or a method of machine Learning for modeling this depletion? (Machine Learning will take more time and resources.)

 How to calculate the depletion rate simply was already asked. You do not need to apply machine learning to this app.

 

Group 7

What if the item is found that is perishable or not permitted in the food bank, should the app include a feature to notify the food bank of this item?
No, the volunteers reject the item and it is never recorded in the app.

2- Would the Thank You Message be more useful with a part including some incentive to donate more items?
I’m open to your suggestions about this; we always need more food. Tell me more.

3- If the location of an item in the storeroom is not the location it is supposed to be, should a feature be implemented to notify the bank of the misplaced item, and show the spot it should be in?
This isn’t needed, the volunteer will use the look-up feature to find the correct location.

4- What if an item is oversupplied and wasting space, should a feature be implemented to calculate the ideal number of units for supply and rate of distribution and notify the bank of how many units should be discarded to allow for other items?
We never throw away food! Please allow the app to register more donations for any item.

5 - If the expiration date cannot be found, should the app mark the item for discard?
Some items, such as paper towels, don’t have expiration dates, so we’ll have to allow these items to remain in our supply list.

RE: Day 2 Questions : Group B4

Should we have the ability to create an account or just log in? (This is a clarification on Group 6 Q 3).
Both

Are stock keeping units divided into groupings with a cap size or just a marking into a one large unit of a certain item?
What do you mean by groupings? Is this, for example, a grouping of “Canned Soup” rather than “Chicken Noodle Soup” and “Tomato Soup”?

Will there be certain parts of the app that will be restricted to volunteers and be exclusive to employees? (Clarification of Group 2 Q 2).
Yes, the manager will have access to donor information so that he can send the thank you emails. Volunteers do not have access to the donor information. (Volunteers do enter the donor information for a single donor, but cannot scroll or browse through all the donor information.)

Should there be a tutorial on how to use the app?
Yes, provide some guidance for users – this can be in app instructions, written documentation, or a YouTube video.

Should there be an aspect to be able to connect to other local food banks in a social aspect?
No, this is not needed.

 

RE: Day 2 Questions group B3

What standards should we use to gage the levels of inventory? What do you mean by ‘standards’?

From day 1, group 3, question 3 (Referenced above) individual item count of all things, or weight of some maybe, cases of others such a quick soups or things often sold in bulk?
The volunteers are taking an inventory and there is a quantity of items which is the number of units. Each item has a size. For example, a jar of peanut butter has a size of 18 oz. There may be 17 jars in stock when the inventory is taken.

Specifies "non-perishable food and supply items" but should include perishable? ----> This means no refrigerated products at all? I.e. Frozen products with long shelf (refridgerated) shelf lives?
No refrigerated or frozen items are kept in the food bank.

What exactly should the thank you email say to the donor exactly?
Donated by:   

Address:         

Phone/E-mail address:          

Date:  

Thank you for your donation of food for our food bank. Your generosity helps us reduce hunger in our area.      

What method of communication should the manager be notified by?
Email

Should the donor email addresses be archived?                   Yes
Group 2

Can the threshold level be changed at all after it has been set for the first time?
Allow the manage to change the threshold level

Name, color, design, logo; up to who?          You may create the design/logo.
Will the using organization provide a thank you message within the app, or will there be a default message? If it is a default message what should it include?
Donated by:   

Address:         

Phone/E-mail address:          

Date:  

Thank you for your donation of food for our food bank. Your generosity helps us reduce hunger in our area.      

 

If an error does occur, what should we show the user?
As with any app, an easy to understand notification with helpful information on how to recover or prevent the error in the future.

How should we notify the user, through phone notifications or emails?
Definitely email, but a phone notification would be “nice to have”.

 

Group 5

If a volunteer accepts an item not already in the system, should a manager be notified, so the manager can set defaults (like optimum supply levels) for the item?
A notification isn’t needed, the voluteers usually set the item(s) aside for the manager to enter later.

 Is it correct to say that the application will not need to record any money transactions (or do any money accounting)? That is correct.
Do you have a LOGO or other artwork which you would like included in the project?  If so, please provide your most high-resolution versions.
You may create the design/logo
Will the manager be the only user that is able to add or remove storage locations (Shelves/Bins) where items can be stored?   Yes
Do you intend to track what donations are provided to individuals / non-profits?
No, we don’t track anyone that we give food to. Only donors and supply levels.

Group 2

Follow up on Q2 Day 2 Group 2. What will the name of the app be?
You may suggest names.

Can users edit their profiles (ex. add profile pictures?)
Yes

Will the thank you emails be sent automatically, or can managers pick and choose who and when to send the thank you emails?
They should be sent automatically.

When creating a manager user account, will there need to be verification proving the user actually is a manager? (ex. like an additional password or some store id)
No

Will there be an option to remove a user from the organization?
Yes, that should be an option for managers, donors, and volunteers.

GROUP 4

Day 1 states Group 5 Q1 response states “It’s a very small operation. The only users are the food bank manager and volunteers.” However, Day 4 Group 2 Q5 states “that should be an option for managers, donors, and volunteers.” We wanted to confirm, will donors be able to login as well?
Donors are not able to log in. (I’m blaming the cold medication for any and all  inconsistencies.)

Should the thank you email also include a ‘receipt’ of what is donated and how much? (Similar to donating to Goodwill, etc) (Referencing Day 2 Group 3 Q3)
           No, that’s not necessary.

Should there be a search function to view different profiles of users in the community (e.g managers to search for volunteers)?
           I like that idea, we would like to be able to search by volunteer name.

Should products that exceed a expiration date be thrown out automatically? Or be notified to employees to remove and update the inventory?
           I would prefer a notification.

Should the manager have an in-app ability to create/edit categories of items donated if it does not fit into a previously specified category?
            Yes.

Group 2:

1. Follow up on day 4 group 2 q1: Here are our suggestions for app names: Bankr, Canned, Candd, Cand, CanD, Foods4U

 Of the options given here, I like Foods4U the best, but I don't have a strong preference. Is that something we can change later?

2. What can donor users do/have access to?

There has been a correction to my earlier response, the types of users are manager and volunteer.

3. What do you want to see when you open the app?

            The app should open with a place for the user to log in.

4. Should the app be light themed or dark themed?

            I prefer a light theme.

5. What should the donation page look like?

I’d like to see a place to look up an existing donor’s contact information or add a new donor’s contact information.

 

Group 5:

1. Do you want to brand your new Android food-bank management app with your organization name?  If so, what is the name of your organization?

The app doesn’t need my organization name.

2. Is there a color scheme that you would like implemented in the app?  (The church choir's robe colors perhaps?)

Nice suggestion, but there may be other organizations using the app, for example the RAM Pantry. So, you may choose the colors.

3. Should we make an Administrator entity? It would be someone who [besides the manager] can create new managers.  In case a manager leaves we need some way of creating a new manager or promoting a volunteer to manager status.

            No

4. Will the app need to be customizable (allow users to change text size/color to aid them)?

It would be ideal if the app is ADA compliant.

 

 

Group 4:

Should we include a map of the location of food item if provided? Or should we just list the shelf number, etc. as was suggested by another team?
A shelf number is fine.

Should the system automatically log out of any current account if it’s inactive for a certain amount of time? If so around how much time should this be?
            One hour is appropriate.

Should the app have an option to locate the closest donation center near them utilizing GPS?
            Not needed.

Should the app have a feature for volunteers to view general information about the product, in terms of health benefits, recipes, etc.?
            Not needed

 

Should there be a spread the word type page for volunteers that gives them instructions on how to get others involved/spread the word to people in need?
Tell me more about this. It might be something I’d like, but I can’t really envision it.

Group 7 

How should we handle a full warehouse, should we notify the manager in a similar manner to food shortages when a user tries to overstock?
 A notification to the manager is what I’d like.

For the thank you message incentive, is there a bonus we could offer, such as tax write-offs? we could also send a link to schedule the next donation.
No

For recording the donations, is there a specific format that you would prefer the output file to be?
I don’t have a preference.

Should we accept items past the expiration date under special circumstances?
No

Is there any specific layout that the food bank wants the app to have?
Can you show me a sketch of what you have in mind?

GROUP 1

Should we be able to export a list of the volunteers?
            Yes

Do the items in the inventory need pictures?
            No

Does the value of the item need to be taken into account when inputting the donation?
            No

Should there be a clear inventory feature that only the manager/administrator have access too?
            No

Should the manager be able to import a list of items anytime? or only allowed once when creating the inventory?
      Anytime. That way it would be easier if we get a large donation to be able to import a list rather than entering the items individually.

Group 4

What type of information should we include for new user accounts? We were thinking: Name, email, username, password, phone, DOB, role, how long they’ve been with the company, and a photo?
    The items I would like are: Name, email, username, password, phone, DOB (optional), role, how long they’ve been with the company, and a photo (optional)

Should there be a Forgot Password option or a Forgot Username option in the login screen?
 Yes to both

Following up on a question from day one from group Group 5 Question 3, about the status of potential sample inventory data available?
  It’s attached here: Sample Inventory.xlsx  (Thanks for your patience while I’ve been sick.)

Should there be a separate portal if the user forgets their login information?
 It can be a link off the log-in page to a recovery screen.

Should we have any sort of security verification for the login? (e.g. two-factor authentication)?
This is a “nice to have” but not required feature.

1. “Do you want any specific layout of buttons and text on the app?”

            I’m very bad with design, can you show me an example?

2. “How many buttons would you like to see? Would you like a button feature to implemented or a certain input feature that allows you to specifically view a stock of a certain item?”

            I really can imagine what it should look like, please give me an example.

3-“Should we include an option to view a visualization of how many food items will be left each day using the depletion rate?”          

            No, I don’t need this.

Should we save user login info so they don't have to log in each time?
You may provide this as a “nice to have” feature, but it’s not required.

Do we need to give access to camera for profile pictures?
You may provide this as a “nice to have” feature, but it’s not required

What should the app do if a volunteer tries to log a new donation in a spot that's already taken?            
What do you mean by “a spot that’s already taken”?

Does the app need to account for how much of an item can fit in a spot?
You may assume that the food pantry has sufficient storage for all donations.

Does the foodbank want its logo as the app thumbnail?
Yes, I’d like that!

Group 6:

What sort of logs would be useful? Ex: When when and what users sign in, when and what donations are made, etc.
It would be good to know when volunteers log in, that way we can thank our volunteers who spend a lot of time helping out at the food bank.

Likewise, we would like to know who donates a lot, so we can thank them, too.

 

Would you like a share button to post donations to social media? Twitter, Facebook, etc.
No

Would you like a place for the Message Of The Day (MOTD) for the app? You can use this space to give updates or suggestions for donations.
This is a “nice to have feature” but not required.
