Sprint 3 backlog:

1. A Manager can click a button on his/her hub page to be taken to a page that displays all of the foods that are depleting fast or are in low stock. So that he/she knows what foods are needed. 

2. A manager can click a button on his/her hub page to be taken to a page where he/she can view the threshold levels of foods so he/she can know whether or not to change them.

3. From the threshold level page, a manager can click on an individual food item to be taken to a page with buttons to alter the threshold level of the food, so that the manager has control over the thresholds.

4. A user can upate their information from the edit profile page and these changes are reflected in the database. 

5. Every night at midnight, the app calculates the depletion rate of all the food items in the inventory, so that the number is up to date daily.

6. A volunteer can click a button on their hub page to be taken to an interface to record donations so that they can accept new inventory.

7. A volunteer, from the add food page, can select a donor from a list of existing donors, or enter a new donor's information so that they can keep track of who's donating.
