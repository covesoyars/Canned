Members: Javier Moreira, Justin Nelson, Sam Portillo, Cove Soyars


## 3/26 updates
We need to create a way to link donors and donations

Need to add the donar first, then add a donation

TODO:
Sam: create a donor database and add donor page; finish up adding up food donations to firebase; create donor list and have a sorta "choose donor to enter donation" that leads to the food donation page

Javier and Cove: work on figuring out sending variables from one activity to another; format the manager's volunteer list to align the buttons to the right side

Justin: work on edit user page; review workflow
